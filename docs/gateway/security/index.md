<Warning>
  **Personal assistant trust model.** This guidance assumes one trusted
  operator boundary per gateway (single-user, personal-assistant model).
  OpenClaw is not a hostile multi-tenant security boundary for multiple
  adversarial users sharing one agent or gateway. For mixed-trust or
  adversarial-user operation, split trust boundaries: separate gateway +
  credentials, ideally separate OS users or hosts.
</Warning>

## Scope: personal assistant security model

- Supported: one user/trust boundary per gateway (prefer one OS user/host/VPS per boundary).
- Not supported: one shared gateway/agent used by mutually untrusted or adversarial users.
- Adversarial-user isolation needs separate gateways (and ideally separate OS users/hosts).
- If several untrusted users can message one tool-enabled agent, they share that agent's delegated tool authority.
- If someone can modify Gateway host state/config (`~/.openclaw`, including `openclaw.json`), treat them as a trusted operator.
- Inside one Gateway, authenticated operator access is a trusted control-plane role, not a per-user tenant role.
- `sessionKey` (session IDs, labels) is a routing selector, not an authorization token.

Hosting multiple users or organizations? Run one isolated Gateway cell per tenant instead of sharing a Gateway. See [Multi-tenant hosting](/gateway/multi-tenant-hosting).

Before changing remote access, DM policy, reverse proxy, or public exposure, run through the [Gateway exposure runbook](/gateway/security/exposure-runbook) as a pre-flight/rollback checklist.

## `openclaw security audit`

Run this after any config change or before exposing network surfaces:

```bash
openclaw security audit
openclaw security audit --deep    # attempts a live Gateway probe
openclaw security audit --fix     # apply safe remediations
openclaw security audit --json
```

`--fix` is intentionally narrow: it flips open group policies to allowlists, tightens state/config/include-file permissions (`600` files, `700` dirs), and on Windows uses ACL resets instead of POSIX `chmod`.

### What the audit checks (high level)

- **Inbound access** - DM/group policies, allowlists: can strangers trigger the bot?
- **Tool blast radius** - elevated tools + open rooms: could prompt injection become shell/file/network actions?
- **Exec filesystem drift** - mutating filesystem tools denied while `exec`/`process` stay available without sandbox constraints.
- **Exec approval drift** - `security="full"`, `autoAllowSkills`, interpreter allowlists without `strictInlineEval`. `security="full"` alone is a broad posture warning, not proof of a bug - it is the chosen default for trusted personal-assistant setups; tighten it only when your threat model needs approval or allowlist guardrails.
- **Network exposure** - Gateway bind/auth, Tailscale Serve/Funnel, weak/short auth tokens.
- **Browser control exposure** - remote nodes, relay ports, remote CDP endpoints.
- **Local disk hygiene** - permissions, symlinks, config includes, synced-folder paths.
- **Plugins** - loading without an explicit allowlist.
- **Policy drift** - sandbox Docker settings configured but sandbox mode off; `gateway.nodes.commands.deny` entries that look effective but only match exact command IDs (for example `system.run`), not shell text inside the payload; dangerous `gateway.nodes.commands.allow` entries; global `tools.profile="minimal"` overridden per agent; plugin-owned tools reachable under a permissive policy.
- **Runtime expectation drift** - assuming implicit exec still means `sandbox` when `tools.exec.host` now defaults to `auto`, or setting `tools.exec.host="sandbox"` while sandbox mode is off.
- **Model hygiene** - warns on legacy configured models (soft warning, not a hard block).

Each finding has a structured `checkId` (for example `gateway.bind_no_auth`, `tools.exec.security_full_configured`). Prefixes: `fs.*` (permissions), `gateway.*` (bind/auth/Tailscale/Control UI/trusted-proxy), `hooks.*`/`browser.*`/`sandbox.*`/`tools.exec.*` (per-surface hardening), `plugins.*`/`skills.*` (supply chain), `security.exposure.*` (access policy x tool blast radius). Full catalog with severity and auto-fix support: [Security audit checks](/gateway/security/audit-checks). See also [Formal Verification](/security/formal-verification).

### Priority order when triaging findings

1. Anything "open" + tools enabled: lock down DMs/groups first (pairing/allowlists), then tighten tool policy/sandboxing.
2. Public network exposure (LAN bind, Funnel, missing auth): fix immediately.
3. Browser control remote exposure: treat like operator access (tailnet-only, pair nodes deliberately, no public exposure).
4. Permissions: state/config/credentials/auth must not be group/world-readable.
5. Plugins: load only what you explicitly trust.
6. Model choice: prefer modern, instruction-hardened models for any bot with tools.

## Hardened baseline in 60 seconds

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    mode: "local",
    bind: "loopback",
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "replace-with-long-random-token" },
  },
  session: {
    dmScope: "per-channel-peer",
  },
  tools: {
    profile: "messaging",
    deny: ["group:automation", "group:runtime", "group:fs", "sessions_spawn", "sessions_send"],
    fs: { workspaceOnly: true },
    exec: { security: "deny", ask: "always" },
    elevated: { enabled: false },
  },
  channels: {
    whatsapp: { dmPolicy: "pairing", groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } } },
  },
}
```

Keeps the Gateway local-only, isolates DMs, and disables control-plane/runtime tools by default. Re-enable tools selectively per trusted agent from there.

Built-in baseline for chat-driven agent turns: non-owner senders cannot use the `cron` or `gateway` tools regardless of config.

### Requester-scoped controls and prompt context

`tools.toolsBySender`, sender ownership, and owner-only tool inventories are evaluated against the current turn's originating requester. They do not authenticate or sanitize other content in that model prompt, including quoted text, prior shared-room history, forwarded content, fetched content, attachments, tool results, or other prompt inputs. Content from another person can therefore influence an owner-triggered turn when it is included in that turn's context.

Treat these controls as defense in depth that reduces direct capability for a requester, not as hostile multi-user isolation. Use `contextVisibility` to filter supported channel-supplied context, restrict tools and sandbox the agent, and use separate gateways and ideally separate OS users or hosts when participants are mutually adversarial.

## Trust boundary matrix

Quick model for triaging risk reports:

| Boundary or control                                       | What it means                                     | Common misread                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gateway.auth` (token/password/trusted-proxy/device auth) | Authenticates callers to gateway APIs             | "Needs per-message signatures on every frame to be secure"                    |
| `sessionKey`                                              | Routing key for context/session selection         | "Session key is a user auth boundary"                                         |
| Prompt/content guardrails                                 | Reduce model abuse risk                           | "Prompt injection alone proves auth bypass"                                   |
| `canvas.eval` / browser evaluate                          | Intentional operator capability when enabled      | "Any JS eval primitive is automatically a vuln in this trust model"           |
| Local TUI `!` shell                                       | Explicit operator-triggered local execution       | "Local shell convenience command is remote injection"                         |
| Node pairing and node commands                            | Operator-level remote execution on paired devices | "Remote device control should be treated as untrusted user access by default" |
| `gateway.nodes.pairing.autoApproveCidrs`                  | Opt-in trusted-network node enrollment policy     | "A disabled-by-default allowlist is an automatic pairing vulnerability"       |
| `gateway.nodes.pairing.sshVerify`                         | Key-verified node enrollment over operator SSH    | "Default-on auto-approval is an automatic pairing vulnerability"              |

## Not vulnerabilities by design

<Accordion title="Common findings closed as no-action">

- Prompt-injection-only chains without a policy, auth, or sandbox bypass.
- Claims that assume hostile multi-tenant operation on one shared host or config.
- Normal operator read-path access (for example `sessions.list` / `sessions.preview` / `chat.history`) classified as IDOR in a shared-gateway setup.
- Localhost-only deployment findings (for example missing HSTS on a loopback-only gateway).
- Discord inbound webhook signature findings for inbound paths that do not exist in this repo.
- Node pairing metadata treated as a hidden second per-command approval layer for `system.run`; the real execution boundary is the gateway's global node command policy plus the node's own exec approvals.
- `gateway.nodes.pairing.sshVerify` treated as a vulnerability because it is enabled by default. It never approves on network locality or SSH reachability alone: the gateway reads the device identity back over SSH (BatchMode, strict host keys) and approves only on an exact device-key match with the pending request, which requires the connecting keypair to already live under the operator's account on a host the operator controls. Probes are bounded to private/CGNAT source addresses, share the trusted-CIDR eligibility floor (fresh scopeless `role: node` only), and `sshVerify: false` turns the feature off.
- `gateway.nodes.pairing.autoApproveCidrs` treated as a vulnerability by itself. It is disabled by default, requires explicit CIDR/IP entries, only applies to first-time `role: node` pairing with no requested scopes, and never auto-approves operator/browser/Control UI, WebChat, role/scope upgrades, metadata or public-key changes, or same-host loopback trusted-proxy header paths (even when loopback trusted-proxy auth is enabled).
- "Missing per-user authorization" findings that treat `sessionKey` as an auth token.

</Accordion>

## Gateway and node trust

Treat Gateway and node as one operator trust domain with different roles:

- **Gateway**: control plane and policy surface (`gateway.auth`, tool policy, routing).
- **Node**: remote execution surface paired to that Gateway (commands, device actions, host-local capabilities).
- A caller authenticated to the Gateway is trusted at Gateway scope; after pairing, node actions are trusted operator actions on that node. See [Operator scopes](/gateway/operator-scopes).
- Direct loopback backend clients authenticated with the shared gateway token/password can make internal control-plane RPCs without presenting a user device identity. This is not a remote or browser pairing bypass - network clients, node clients, device-token clients, and explicit device identities still go through pairing and scope-upgrade enforcement.
- Exec approvals (allowlist + ask) are guardrails for operator intent, not hostile multi-tenant isolation. They bind exact request context and best-effort direct local file operands; they do not semantically model every runtime/interpreter loader path. Use sandboxing and host isolation for strong boundaries.
- Trusted single-operator default: host exec on `gateway`/`node` is allowed without approval prompts (`security="full"`, `ask="off"`). That is intentional UX, not a vulnerability by itself.

For hostile-user isolation, split trust boundaries by OS user/host and run separate gateways.

## Threat model

Your AI assistant can execute arbitrary shell commands, read/write files, access network services, and send messages to anyone (if given channel access). People who message it can try to trick it into doing bad things, social-engineer access to your data, or probe for infrastructure details.

Most failures here are not exotic exploits - they are "someone messaged the bot and the bot did what they asked." OpenClaw's stance, in order:

1. **Identity first** - decide who can talk to the bot (DM pairing / allowlists / explicit "open").
2. **Scope next** - decide where the bot can act (group allowlists + mention gating, tools, sandboxing, device permissions).
3. **Model last** - assume the model can be manipulated; design so manipulation has limited blast radius.

## DM access: pairing, allowlist, open, disabled

Every DM-capable channel supports `dmPolicy` (or `*.dm.policy`), which gates inbound DMs before the message is processed:

| Policy      | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pairing`   | Default. Unknown senders get a pairing code; bot ignores them until approved. Codes expire after 1 hour; repeated DMs do not resend a code until a new request is created. Pending requests capped at 3 per channel. |
| `allowlist` | Unknown senders blocked, no pairing handshake.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `open`      | Anyone can DM (public). Requires the channel allowlist to include `"*"` (explicit opt-in).                                                                                                                           |
| `disabled`  | Inbound DMs ignored entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

```bash
openclaw pairing list <channel>
openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code>
```

Details + files on disk: [Pairing](/channels/pairing)

Treat `dmPolicy="open"` and `groupPolicy="open"` as last-resort settings; prefer pairing + allowlists unless you fully trust every member of the room.

### Allowlists (two layers)

- **DM allowlist** (`allowFrom` / `channels.discord.allowFrom` / `channels.slack.allowFrom`; legacy: `channels.discord.dm.allowFrom`, `channels.slack.dm.allowFrom`): who can DM the bot. When `dmPolicy="pairing"`, approvals write to `~/.openclaw/credentials/<channel>-allowFrom.json` (default account) or `<channel>-<accountId>-allowFrom.json` (non-default accounts), merged with config allowlists.
- **Group allowlist** (channel-specific): which groups/channels/guilds the bot accepts at all.
  - `channels.whatsapp.groups`, `channels.telegram.groups`, `channels.imessage.groups`: per-group defaults like `requireMention`; when set, also acts as a group allowlist (include `"*"` to keep allow-all behavior). Customize mention triggers with `agents.entries.*.groupChat.mentionPatterns` (for example `["@openclaw", "@mybot"]`) so `requireMention` gates on your own bot names.
  - `groupPolicy="allowlist"` + `groupAllowFrom`: restrict who can trigger the bot inside a group session (WhatsApp/Telegram/Signal/iMessage/Microsoft Teams).
  - `channels.discord.guilds` / `channels.slack.channels`: per-surface allowlists + mention defaults.
  - Check order: `groupPolicy`/group allowlists first, then mention/reply activation. Replying to a bot message (implicit mention) does **not** bypass `groupAllowFrom`.

Details: [Configuration](/gateway/configuration) and [Groups](/channels/groups)

### DM session isolation (multi-user mode)

By default, OpenClaw routes all DMs into the main session for cross-device continuity. If multiple people can DM the bot (open DMs or a multi-person allowlist), isolate DM sessions:

```json5
{ session: { dmScope: "per-channel-peer" } }
```

`session.dmScope` values:

| Value                      | Scope                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main` (config default)    | All DMs share one session.                                             |
| `per-channel-peer`         | Each channel+sender pair gets an isolated DM context (secure DM mode). |
| `per-account-channel-peer` | Like above, split further by account (multi-account channels).         |
| `per-peer`                 | Each sender gets one session across all channels of the same type.     |

Local CLI onboarding preserves an explicit `session.dmScope` and otherwise leaves it unset, so the `"main"` default applies: all direct messages across channels share the agent's rolling main session (the personal-agent default). For shared or multi-user inboxes, set `session.dmScope: "per-channel-peer"`; `openclaw security audit` recommends isolation when it detects multi-user DM traffic.

This is a messaging-context boundary, not a host-admin boundary. If users are mutually adversarial and share the same Gateway host/config, run separate gateways per trust boundary instead.

If the same person contacts you on multiple channels, use `session.identityLinks` to collapse those DM sessions into one canonical identity. See [Session Management](/concepts/session) and [Configuration](/gateway/configuration).

## Context visibility vs trigger authorization

Two separate concepts:

- **Trigger authorization**: who can trigger the agent (`dmPolicy`, `groupPolicy`, allowlists, mention gates).
- **Context visibility**: what supplemental context reaches the model (reply body, quoted text, thread history, forwarded metadata).

`contextVisibility` controls the second:

- `"all"` (default): supplemental context kept as received.
- `"allowlist"`: supplemental context filtered to senders allowed by active allowlist checks.
- `"allowlist_quote"`: like `allowlist`, but still keeps one explicit quoted reply.

Set per channel or per room/conversation - see [Groups](/channels/groups#context-visibility-and-allowlists). Reports that only show "model can see quoted/historical text from non-allowlisted senders" are hardening findings addressable with `contextVisibility`, not auth or sandbox bypasses by themselves; a security-impacting report still needs a demonstrated trust-boundary bypass.

## Prompt injection

An attacker crafts a message that manipulates the model into unsafe action ("ignore your instructions", "dump your filesystem", "follow this link and run commands"). Prompt injection is **not solved** by system prompt guardrails alone - those are soft guidance; hard enforcement comes from tool policy, exec approvals, sandboxing, and channel allowlists (which operators can still disable by design).

Prompt injection does not require public DMs: even if only you can message the bot, any **untrusted content** it reads (web search/fetch results, browser pages, emails, docs, attachments, pasted logs/code) can carry adversarial instructions. The content itself is a threat surface, not just the sender.

Red flags to treat as untrusted:

- "Read this file/URL and do exactly what it says."
- "Ignore your system prompt or safety rules."
- "Reveal your hidden instructions or tool outputs."
- "Paste the full contents of ~/.openclaw or your logs."

What helps in practice:

- Keep inbound DMs locked down (pairing/allowlists); prefer mention gating in groups; avoid always-on bots in public rooms.
- Treat links, attachments, and pasted instructions as hostile by default.
- Run sensitive tool execution in a sandbox; keep secrets out of the agent's reachable filesystem. Sandboxing is opt-in: if sandbox mode is off, implicit `host=auto` resolves to the gateway host, while explicit `host=sandbox` still fails closed (no sandbox runtime available). Set `host=gateway` to make that behavior explicit in config.
- Limit high-risk tools (`exec`, `browser`, `web_fetch`, `web_search`) to trusted agents or explicit allowlists.
- If you allowlist interpreters (`python`, `node`, `ruby`, `perl`, `php`, `lua`, `osascript`), enable `tools.exec.strictInlineEval` so inline eval forms (`-c`, `-e`, and similar) still need explicit approval. In allowlist mode, any heredoc segment (`<<`) always requires reviewer or explicit approval, regardless of quoting - an allowlisted command cannot use a heredoc body to bypass allowlist review.
- Reduce blast radius by using a read-only or tool-disabled **reader agent** to summarize untrusted content, then pass the summary to your main agent.
- For Gmail hooks, the built-in per-message session isolates conversation context but does not remove the target agent's tool or workspace permissions. Route untrusted mail to a dedicated reader agent, apply [per-agent sandbox and tool restrictions](/tools/multi-agent-sandbox-tools), and constrain any handoff to the main agent with [`tools.agentToAgent`](/gateway/config-tools#toolsagenttoagent). See [Gmail integration](/gateway/configuration-reference#gmail-integration).
- Keep `web_search` / `web_fetch` / `browser` off for tool-enabled agents unless needed.
- For OpenResponses URL inputs (`input_file` / `input_image`), set a tight `gateway.http.endpoints.responses.files.urlAllowlist` / `images.urlAllowlist` and keep `maxUrlParts` low (empty allowlists count as unset). Use `files.allowUrl: false` / `images.allowUrl: false` to disable URL fetching entirely.
- Keep secrets out of prompts; pass them via env/config on the gateway host instead.

**Model choice matters.** Prompt-injection resistance is not uniform across model tiers - smaller/cheaper models are more susceptible to tool misuse and instruction hijacking under adversarial prompts.

<Warning>
For tool-enabled agents or agents that read untrusted content, prompt-injection risk with older/smaller models is often too high. Do not run those workloads on weak model tiers.
</Warning>

- Use the latest-generation, best-tier model for any bot that can run tools or touch files/networks.
- Do not use older/weaker/smaller tiers for tool-enabled agents or untrusted inboxes.
- If you must use a smaller model, reduce blast radius: read-only tools, strong sandboxing, minimal filesystem access, strict allowlists. Enable sandboxing for all sessions and disable `web_search`/`web_fetch`/`browser` unless inputs are tightly controlled.
- For chat-only personal assistants with trusted input and no tools, smaller models are usually fine.

### External content and untrusted-input wrapping

OpenResponses `input_file` text is still injected as untrusted external content even though the Gateway decodes it locally - the block carries `<<<EXTERNAL_UNTRUSTED_CONTENT ...>>>` boundary markers plus `Source: External` metadata (this path omits the longer `SECURITY NOTICE:` banner used elsewhere). The same marker-based wrapping applies when media-understanding extracts text from attached documents before appending it to the media prompt.

OpenClaw also strips common self-hosted LLM chat-template special-token literals (Qwen/ChatML, Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Phi, GPT-OSS role/turn tokens) from wrapped external content and metadata before they reach the model. Self-hosted OpenAI-compatible backends (vLLM, SGLang, TGI, LM Studio, custom Hugging Face tokenizer stacks) sometimes tokenize literal strings like `<|im_start|>` or `<|start_header_id|>` as structural chat-template tokens inside user content; without this sanitization, untrusted text in a fetched page, email body, or file-contents tool output could forge a synthetic `assistant`/`system` role boundary. Sanitization happens at the external-content wrapping layer, so it applies uniformly across fetch/read tools and inbound channel content. Hosted providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) already apply their own request-side sanitization; keep external-content wrapping enabled and prefer backend settings that split/escape special tokens when available.

Outbound model responses have a separate sanitizer that strips leaked `<tool_call>`, `<function_calls>`, `<system-reminder>`, `<previous_response>`, and similar internal scaffolding from user-visible replies at the final channel delivery boundary.

This does not replace `dmPolicy`, allowlists, exec approvals, sandboxing, or `contextVisibility` - it closes one specific tokenizer-layer bypass.

### Bypass flags (keep off in production)

- `hooks.mappings[].allowUnsafeExternalContent`
- `hooks.gmail.allowUnsafeExternalContent`
- Cron payload field `allowUnsafeExternalContent`

Only enable temporarily for tightly scoped debugging; if enabled, isolate that agent (sandbox + minimal tools + dedicated session namespace).

Hook payloads are untrusted content even when delivery comes from systems you control (mail/docs/web content can carry prompt injection). Weak model tiers increase this risk - for hook-driven automation, prefer strong modern model tiers and keep tool policy tight (`tools.profile: "messaging"` or stricter), plus sandboxing where possible.

### Reasoning and verbose output in groups

`/reasoning`, `/verbose`, and `/trace` can expose internal reasoning, tool output, or plugin diagnostics not meant for a public channel - they can include tool args, URLs, plugin diagnostics, and data the model saw. Keep them disabled in public rooms; enable only in trusted DMs or tightly controlled rooms.

## Command authorization

Slash commands and directives are honored only for authorized senders, derived from channel allowlists/pairing plus `commands.useAccessGroups` (see [Configuration](/gateway/configuration) and [Slash commands](/tools/slash-commands)). If a channel allowlist is empty or includes `"*"`, commands are effectively open for that channel.

`/exec` is a session-only convenience for authorized operators - it does not write config or change other sessions.

## Control plane tools

Two built-in tools remain control-plane sensitive:

- `gateway` reads config with `config.schema.lookup` / `config.get`. It cannot write config, update OpenClaw, or restart the Gateway.
- `cron` creates scheduled jobs that keep running after the original chat/task ends.

The `gateway` tool stays owner-only because config reads can expose secrets and host topology. Agents request persistent config or lifecycle changes through the `openclaw` delegation tool; OpenClaw maps them to typed operations and requires human approval before applying them. See [OpenClaw setup agent](/cli/openclaw#operations-and-approval).

For any agent/surface handling untrusted content, deny these by default:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    deny: ["gateway", "cron", "sessions_spawn", "sessions_send"],
  },
}
```

`commands.restart=false` disables `/restart` and external `SIGUSR1` restart requests. The `gateway` agent tool has no restart action.

## Node execution (`system.run`)

If a macOS node is paired, the Gateway can invoke `system.run` on it - this is remote code execution on that Mac.

- Requires node pairing (approval + token). Pairing establishes node identity/trust and token issuance; it is not a per-command approval surface.
- The Gateway applies a coarse global node command policy via `gateway.nodes.commands.allow` / `gateway.nodes.commands.deny`. The deny list matches exact node command names only (for example `system.run`), not shell text inside a command payload - a reconnecting node advertising a different command list is not, by itself, a vulnerability if the gateway global policy and the node's own exec approvals still enforce the boundary.
- The per-node `system.run` policy is the node's own exec approvals file (`exec.approvals.node.*`), controlled on the Mac via Settings -> Exec approvals (security + ask + allowlist); it can be stricter or looser than the gateway's global command-ID policy.
- A node running `security="full"` and `ask="off"` follows the default trusted-operator model - expected behavior, not a bug, unless your deployment needs a tighter stance.
- Approval mode binds exact request context and, when possible, one concrete local script/file operand. If OpenClaw cannot identify exactly one direct local file for an interpreter/runtime command, approval-backed execution is denied rather than promising full semantic coverage.
- For `host=node`, approval-backed runs also store a canonical prepared `systemRunPlan`; later approved forwards reuse that stored plan, and gateway validation rejects caller edits to command/cwd/session context after the approval request was created.
- To disable remote execution entirely: set security to `deny` and remove node pairing for that Mac.

## Dynamic skills (watcher / remote nodes)

OpenClaw can refresh the skills list mid-session: the skills watcher updates the snapshot on the next agent turn when `SKILL.md` changes, and connecting a macOS node can make macOS-only skills eligible (based on bin probing). Treat skill folders as trusted code and restrict who can modify them.

## Plugins

Plugins run in-process with the Gateway - treat them as trusted code.

- Only install from sources you trust; prefer explicit `plugins.allow` allowlists; review plugin config before enabling; restart the Gateway after plugin changes.
- Installing/updating plugins runs executable code:
  - The install path is the per-plugin directory under the active plugin install root.
  - ClawHub packages and OpenClaw's bundled/official catalog are trusted sources. A new arbitrary npm, `npm-pack:`, git, local path/archive, or marketplace source warns before install; noninteractive installs require `--force` after you review and trust that source. `--force` confirms provenance and permits overwrite; it does not bypass `security.installPolicy` or remaining install safety checks. Updates reuse the already selected source.
  - OpenClaw does not run built-in local dangerous-code blocking during install/update. Use `security.installPolicy` for operator-owned local allow/warn/block decisions and `openclaw security audit --deep` for diagnostic scanning.
  - npm and git plugin installs run package-manager dependency convergence only during the explicit install/update flow. Local paths and archives are treated as self-contained packages; OpenClaw copies/references them without running `npm install`.
  - Prefer pinned exact versions (`@scope/pkg@1.2.3`) and inspect the unpacked code before enabling.
  - `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` acknowledges a reviewed `security.installPolicy` warning for one CLI install/update request. It does not bypass a policy `block`, policy failure, or the plugin dependency denylist.
  - Compatibility note: this legacy flag was inert in older releases. With install-policy warnings enabled, existing automation that still passes it now acknowledges `warn` decisions for that request.
  - `security.installPolicy` lets operators run a trusted local command to make host-specific allow/warn/block decisions for skill and plugin installs. A warning requires explicit acknowledgement; a block is terminal. Policy runs after source material is staged but before install continues and applies to ClawHub skills too.

## Sandboxing

Dedicated doc: [Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing)

Two complementary approaches:

- **Full Gateway in Docker** (container boundary): [Docker](/install/docker)
- **Tool sandbox** (`agents.defaults.sandbox`; host gateway + sandbox-isolated tools; Docker is the default backend): [Sandboxing](/gateway/sandboxing)

<Note>
To prevent cross-agent access, keep `agents.defaults.sandbox.scope` at `"agent"` (default) or use `"session"` for stricter per-session isolation. `scope: "shared"` uses a single container or workspace.
</Note>

Agent workspace access inside the sandbox (`agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceAccess`):

- `"none"` (default): tools see a sandbox workspace under `~/.openclaw/sandboxes`; agent workspace is off-limits.
- `"ro"`: mounts the agent workspace read-only at `/agent` (disables `write`/`edit`/`apply_patch`).
- `"rw"`: mounts the agent workspace read/write at `/workspace`.

Extra `sandbox.docker.binds` are validated against normalized, canonicalized source paths. A blocked-path denylist covers `/etc`, `/private/etc`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/root`, `/boot`, and directories that commonly contain or alias the Docker socket (`/run`, `/var/run`, and `docker.sock` under them), plus HOME credential subpaths (`.aws`, `.cargo`, `.config`, `.docker`, `.gnupg`, `.netrc`, `.npm`, `.ssh`). Parent-symlink tricks and canonical home aliases are resolved through existing ancestors and re-checked, so they still fail closed if they resolve into a blocked root.

<Warning>
`tools.elevated` is the global baseline escape hatch that runs exec outside the sandbox. The effective host is `gateway` by default, or `node` when the exec target is configured to `node`. Keep `tools.elevated.allowFrom` tight and do not enable it for strangers. Further restrict per agent via `agents.entries.*.tools.elevated`. See [Elevated mode](/tools/elevated).
</Warning>

### Sub-agent delegation guardrail

If you allow session tools, treat delegated sub-agent runs as another boundary decision:

- Deny `sessions_spawn` unless the agent truly needs delegation.
- Keep `agents.defaults.subagents.allowAgents` and any per-agent `agents.entries.*.subagents.allowAgents` overrides restricted to known-safe target agents.
- For workflows that must remain sandboxed, call `sessions_spawn` with `sandbox: "require"` (default is `"inherit"`); `"require"` fails fast when the target child runtime is not sandboxed.

### Read-only mode

Build a read-only profile by combining `agents.defaults.sandbox.workspaceAccess: "ro"` (or `"none"` for no workspace access) with tool allow/deny lists that block `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`, `exec`, `process`, etc.

- `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: true` (default): keeps `apply_patch` from writing/deleting outside the workspace directory even with sandboxing off. Set `false` only if you intentionally want `apply_patch` to touch files outside the workspace.
- `tools.fs.workspaceOnly: true` (optional): restricts `read`/`write`/`edit`/`apply_patch` paths and native prompt image auto-load paths to the workspace directory.
- Keep filesystem roots narrow - avoid broad roots like your home directory for agent/sandbox workspaces, which can expose sensitive local files (for example state/config under `~/.openclaw`) to filesystem tools.

## Per-agent access profiles (multi-agent)

Each agent can have its own sandbox + tool policy: full access, read-only, or no access. See [Multi-Agent Sandbox & Tools](/tools/multi-agent-sandbox-tools) for precedence rules.

Common patterns: personal agent (full access, no sandbox), family/work agent (sandboxed + read-only tools), public agent (sandboxed + no filesystem/shell tools).

### Full access (no sandbox)

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      { id: "personal", workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-personal", sandbox: { mode: "off" } },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Read-only tools + read-only workspace

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "family",
        workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-family",
        sandbox: { mode: "all", scope: "agent", workspaceAccess: "ro" },
        tools: {
          allow: ["read"],
          deny: ["write", "edit", "apply_patch", "exec", "process", "browser"],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### No filesystem/shell access (provider messaging allowed)

```json5
{
  agents: {
    list: [
      {
        id: "public",
        workspace: "~/.openclaw/workspace-public",
        sandbox: { mode: "all", scope: "agent", workspaceAccess: "none" },
        tools: {
          // Session tools can reveal transcript data. Default scope is current + spawned;
          // reads also include same-agent groups watched through ambient group awareness.
          // Use visibility: "self" to exclude those watched sessions.
          sessions: { visibility: "tree" }, // self | tree | agent | all
          allow: [
            "sessions_list",
            "sessions_history",
            "sessions_send",
            "sessions_spawn",
            "session_status",
            "discord",
            "slack",
            "telegram",
            "whatsapp",
          ],
          deny: [
            "apply_patch",
            "browser",
            "canvas",
            "cron",
            "edit",
            "exec",
            "gateway",
            "image",
            "nodes",
            "process",
            "read",
            "write",
          ],
        },
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

## Browser control risks

Enabling browser control gives the model a real browser. If that profile already has logged-in sessions, the model can access those accounts and data - treat browser profiles as sensitive state.

- Prefer a dedicated profile for the agent (the default `openclaw` profile); avoid your personal daily-driver profile.
- Keep host browser control disabled for sandboxed agents unless you trust them.
- The standalone loopback browser control API only honors shared-secret auth (gateway token bearer auth or gateway password) - it does not consume trusted-proxy or Tailscale Serve identity headers.
- Treat browser downloads as untrusted input; prefer an isolated downloads directory.
- Disable browser sync/password managers in the agent profile if possible.
- For remote gateways, "browser control" is equivalent to "operator access" to whatever that profile can reach.
- Keep Gateway and node hosts tailnet-only; avoid exposing browser control ports to LAN or public internet.
- Disable browser proxy routing when not needed (`gateway.nodes.browser.mode="off"`).
- Chrome MCP existing-session mode is not "safer" - it can act as you in whatever that host Chrome profile can reach.
- Run a **node host** on the browser machine and let the Gateway proxy browser actions when the Gateway is remote from the browser (see [Browser tool](/tools/browser)); treat node pairing like admin access, keep Gateway and node host on the same tailnet, and avoid exposing relay/control ports over LAN, public internet, or Tailscale Funnel.

### Browser SSRF policy (strict by default)

Private/internal destinations stay blocked unless you explicitly opt in.

- Default: `browser.ssrfPolicy.dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork` unset, so private/internal/special-use destinations stay blocked. Legacy alias `allowPrivateNetwork` still accepted.
- Opt-in: set `dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork: true` to allow those destinations.
- In strict mode, use `hostnameAllowlist` (patterns like `*.example.com`) and `allowedHostnames` (exact host exceptions, including otherwise-blocked names like `localhost`) for explicit exceptions.
- Direct navigation requests are preflight checked. During the action and bounded post-action grace, guarded Playwright interactions (click, coordinate click, hover, drag, scroll, select, press, type, form fill, and evaluate) intercept policy-denied top-level and subframe document loads before HTTP request bytes, then best-effort re-check the final `http(s)` URL.
- Before each fresh managed Chrome launch, OpenClaw best-effort disables network prediction, suppressing Chromium's observed speculative preconnect for those denied loads. This is defense in depth, not a policy boundary: a browser reused across a control-service restart and other browser backends may not share the hardening. Page routing remains request-level interception, not a network firewall: redirect hops, a popup's first request, Service Worker traffic, page code that runs after the bounded guard window, and some background/subresource paths can bypass it. Final-URL checks remain detection/quarantine defense; complete prevention requires owner-side egress isolation or a policy-enforcing proxy.

```json5
{
  browser: {
    ssrfPolicy: {
      dangerouslyAllowPrivateNetwork: false,
      hostnameAllowlist: ["*.example.com", "example.com"],
      allowedHostnames: ["localhost"],
    },
  },
}
```

## Network exposure

### Bind, port, firewall

The Gateway multiplexes WebSocket + HTTP on one port (default `18789`; config/flags/env: `gateway.port`, `--port`, `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`). That HTTP surface includes the Control UI (SPA assets, default base path `/`) and the canvas host (`/__openclaw__/canvas` and `/__openclaw__/a2ui` - arbitrary HTML/JS; treat as untrusted content when loaded in a normal browser; do not expose it to untrusted networks/users or share an origin with privileged web surfaces).

`gateway.bind` controls where the Gateway listens:

- `"loopback"` (default): only local clients can connect.
- `"lan"`, `"tailnet"`, `"custom"`: expand the attack surface. Only use with gateway auth (shared token/password, or a correctly configured trusted proxy) and a real firewall.

Rules of thumb: prefer Tailscale Serve over LAN binds (Serve keeps the Gateway on loopback and Tailscale handles access); if you must bind to LAN, firewall the port to a tight source-IP allowlist rather than port-forwarding broadly; never expose the Gateway unauthenticated on `0.0.0.0`.

### Docker port publishing with UFW

Published container ports (`-p HOST:CONTAINER` or Compose `ports:`) route through Docker's forwarding chains, not only host `INPUT` rules. Enforce rules in `DOCKER-USER` (evaluated before Docker's own accept rules); most modern distros use the `iptables-nft` frontend, which still applies these rules to the nftables backend.

```bash
# /etc/ufw/after.rules (append as its own *filter section)
*filter
:DOCKER-USER - [0:0]
-A DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -s 127.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -s 172.16.0.0/12 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -s 192.168.0.0/16 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -s 100.64.0.0/10 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 80 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -p tcp --dport 443 -j RETURN
-A DOCKER-USER -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j DROP
-A DOCKER-USER -j RETURN
COMMIT
```

IPv6 has separate tables - add a matching policy in `/etc/ufw/after6.rules` if Docker IPv6 is enabled. Avoid hardcoding interface names (`eth0`) since they vary across VPS images (`ens3`, `enp*`, etc.) and a mismatch can silently skip your deny rule.

```bash
ufw reload
iptables -S DOCKER-USER
ip6tables -S DOCKER-USER
nmap -sT -p 1-65535 <public-ip> --open
```

Expected external ports should be only what you intentionally expose (for most setups: SSH + reverse proxy ports).

### mDNS/Bonjour discovery

When the bundled `bonjour` plugin is enabled, the Gateway broadcasts presence via mDNS (`_openclaw-gw._tcp`, port 5353) for local device discovery. Full mode includes TXT records that expose operational details: `cliPath` (filesystem path revealing username and install location), `sshPort` (advertises SSH availability), `displayName`/`lanHost` (hostname info). Broadcasting infrastructure details makes LAN reconnaissance easier.

- Keep Bonjour disabled unless LAN discovery is needed - it auto-starts on macOS hosts and is opt-in elsewhere; direct Gateway URLs, Tailnet, SSH, or wide-area DNS-SD avoid local multicast.
- **Minimal mode** (default when Bonjour is enabled, recommended for exposed gateways) omits sensitive fields:

  ```json5
  { discovery: { mdns: { mode: "minimal" } } }
  ```

- **Off** suppresses local discovery while keeping the plugin enabled:

  ```json5
  { discovery: { mdns: { mode: "off" } } }
  ```

- **Full mode** (opt-in) includes `cliPath` + `sshPort`:

  ```json5
  { discovery: { mdns: { mode: "full" } } }
  ```

- Or set `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_BONJOUR=1` to disable mDNS without config changes.

In minimal mode the Gateway broadcasts `role`, `gatewayPort`, `transport` but omits `cliPath`/`sshPort`; apps that need the CLI path can fetch it over the authenticated WebSocket connection instead.

### Gateway WebSocket auth

Gateway auth is required by default - with no valid auth path configured, the Gateway refuses WebSocket connections (fail-closed). Onboarding generates a token by default (even for loopback) so local clients must authenticate.

```json5
{ gateway: { auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-token" } } }
```

`openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token` can generate one for you.

<Note>
`gateway.remote.token` and `gateway.remote.password` are client credential sources - they do not protect local WS access by themselves. Local call paths use `gateway.remote.*` only as fallback when `gateway.auth.*` is unset. If `gateway.auth.token` or `gateway.auth.password` is explicitly configured via SecretRef and unresolved, resolution fails closed (no remote-fallback masking).
</Note>

Pin remote TLS with `gateway.remote.tlsFingerprint` when using `wss://`. Plaintext `ws://` is accepted for loopback, private IP literals, `.local`, and Tailnet `*.ts.net` gateway URLs; for other trusted private-DNS names, set `OPENCLAW_ALLOW_INSECURE_PRIVATE_WS=1` on the client process as break-glass (process environment only, not an `openclaw.json` key). Mobile pairing and Android manual/scanned gateway routes are stricter: cleartext only for loopback, while private-LAN, link-local, `.local`, and dotless hostnames must use TLS unless you explicitly opt into the trusted private-network cleartext path.

Device pairing is auto-approved for direct local loopback connects (plus a narrow backend/container-local self-connect path for trusted shared-secret helper flows); Tailnet and LAN connects, including same-host connections to a tailnet address, are treated as remote and still need approval. A resolved `tailnet` address or `custom` address other than `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0` adds a separate `127.0.0.1` listener; only connections to that local listener receive loopback semantics. Forwarded-header evidence on a loopback request disqualifies loopback locality; metadata-upgrade auto-approval is scoped narrowly. See [Gateway pairing](/gateway/pairing).

Auth modes:

- `"token"`: shared bearer token (recommended for most setups).
- `"password"`: prefer setting via `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`.
- `"trusted-proxy"`: trust an identity-aware reverse proxy to authenticate users and pass identity via headers. See [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth).

Rotation checklist (token/password): generate/set a new secret (`gateway.auth.token` or `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`); restart the Gateway (or the macOS app if it supervises the Gateway); update remote clients (`gateway.remote.token`/`.password`); verify the old credentials no longer work.

### Tailscale Serve identity headers

When `gateway.auth.allowTailscale` is `true` (default for Serve), OpenClaw accepts the Tailscale Serve identity header `tailscale-user-login` for Control UI/WebSocket authentication. It verifies identity by resolving the `x-forwarded-for` address through the local Tailscale daemon (`tailscale whois`) and matching it to the header - this only triggers for loopback requests carrying `x-forwarded-for`, `x-forwarded-proto`, and `x-forwarded-host` as injected by Tailscale. For this async check, failed attempts for the same `{scope, ip}` are serialized before the limiter records the failure, so concurrent bad retries from one Serve client can lock out the second attempt immediately.

HTTP API endpoints (`/v1/*`, `/tools/invoke`, `/api/channels/*`) do not use Tailscale identity-header auth - they follow the gateway's configured HTTP auth mode.

Gateway HTTP bearer auth is effectively all-or-nothing operator access. Credentials that can call `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, plugin routes such as `/api/v1/admin/rpc`, or `/api/channels/*` are full-access operator secrets for that gateway: shared-secret bearer auth restores the full default operator scopes (`operator.admin`, `operator.approvals`, `operator.pairing`, `operator.read`, `operator.talk.secrets`, `operator.write`) and owner semantics for agent turns, and narrower `x-openclaw-scopes` values do not reduce that shared-secret path. Per-request scope semantics only apply when the request comes from an identity-bearing mode (trusted proxy auth) or an explicitly no-auth private ingress; in those modes, omitting `x-openclaw-scopes` falls back to the normal operator default scope set, and owner-level headers like `x-openclaw-model` require `operator.admin` when scopes are narrowed. `/tools/invoke` and HTTP session history endpoints follow the same shared-secret rule. Do not share these credentials with untrusted callers; prefer separate gateways per trust boundary.

Tokenless Serve auth assumes the gateway host itself is trusted - it is not protection against hostile same-host processes. If untrusted local code may run on the gateway host, disable `allowTailscale` and require explicit shared-secret auth (`token` or `password`).

Do not forward these headers from your own reverse proxy. If you terminate TLS or proxy in front of the gateway, disable `allowTailscale` and use shared-secret auth or [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth) instead.

See [Tailscale](/gateway/tailscale) and [Web overview](/web).

### Reverse proxy configuration

Set `gateway.trustedProxies` for proper forwarded-client IP handling behind nginx/Caddy/Traefik/etc. When the Gateway detects proxy headers from an address **not** in `trustedProxies`, it will not treat the connection as local; if gateway auth is disabled, that connection is rejected. This prevents proxied connections from appearing to come from localhost and receiving automatic trust.

`trustedProxies` also feeds `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"`, which is stricter: it fails closed on loopback-source proxies by default. Same-host loopback reverse proxies can use `trustedProxies` for local-client detection and forwarded-IP handling, but can only satisfy `trusted-proxy` auth mode when `gateway.auth.trustedProxy.allowLoopback = true`; otherwise use token/password auth.

```yaml
gateway:
  trustedProxies:
    - "10.0.0.1" # reverse proxy IP
  allowRealIpFallback: false # default false; only enable if your proxy cannot provide X-Forwarded-For
  auth:
    mode: password
    password: ${OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD}
```

When `trustedProxies` is set, the Gateway uses `X-Forwarded-For` to determine client IP; `X-Real-IP` is ignored unless `gateway.allowRealIpFallback: true` is explicitly set. Ensure your proxy **overwrites** `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Real-IP` rather than appending to them:

```nginx
# good
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;

# bad: preserves/appends untrusted client-supplied values
proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
```

Trusted proxy headers do not make node device pairing automatically trusted - `gateway.nodes.pairing.autoApproveCidrs` is a separate, disabled-by-default operator policy, and loopback-source trusted-proxy header paths stay excluded from node auto-approval even when loopback trusted-proxy auth is enabled (because local callers can forge those headers).

### HSTS and origin notes

- OpenClaw's gateway is local/loopback first. If you terminate TLS at a reverse proxy, set HSTS there.
- If the gateway itself terminates HTTPS, `gateway.http.securityHeaders.strictTransportSecurity` emits the HSTS header from OpenClaw responses.
- Non-loopback Control UI deployments require `gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins` by default; `allowedOrigins: ["*"]` is an explicit allow-all policy, not a hardened default - avoid it outside tightly controlled local testing.
- Failed authentication from loopback is never locked out, so a local CLI cannot be denied before its credentials are checked. Wrong credentials are still tracked and progressively delayed (bounded delay, one shared timer per key); successful authentication resets the failure history. This raises the cost of repeated guessing from one loopback source; it is not a defense against an attacker who can already open many parallel loopback connections, because credentials are compared before the failure response is delayed. Loopback reachability is a trust boundary in its own right - see [Node pairing](/gateway/pairing#silent-local-pairing).
- Browser-origin auth failures on loopback are still rate-limited even with the general loopback exemption enabled, but the lockout key is scoped per normalized `Origin` value instead of one shared localhost bucket.
- `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyAllowHostHeaderOriginFallback=true` enables Host-header origin fallback mode; treat it as a dangerous operator-selected policy.
- Treat DNS rebinding and proxy-host header behavior as deployment hardening concerns; keep `trustedProxies` tight and avoid exposing the gateway directly to the public internet.
- Detailed deployment guidance: [Trusted Proxy Auth](/gateway/trusted-proxy-auth#tls-termination-and-hsts).

### Control UI over HTTP

The Control UI needs a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) to generate device identity.

- `gateway.controlUi.allowInsecureAuth`: local compatibility toggle. On localhost, allows Control UI auth without device identity when the page loads over non-secure HTTP. Does not bypass pairing checks and does not relax remote (non-localhost) device identity requirements. Prefer HTTPS (Tailscale Serve) or open the UI on `127.0.0.1`.
- `gateway.controlUi.dangerouslyDisableDeviceAuth`: retired break-glass input. Older configs preserve authenticated, pairing-only Control UI access for remediation until a browser reopened over HTTPS or localhost completes the bounded, explicit self-pairing migration; do not add it to current config.
- Separate from those flags, a successful `gateway.auth.mode: "trusted-proxy"` can admit **operator** Control UI sessions without device identity - an intentional auth-mode behavior, not an `allowInsecureAuth` shortcut, and it does not extend to node-role Control UI sessions.

`openclaw security audit` warns when `allowInsecureAuth` is enabled.

### Insecure/dangerous flags

`openclaw security audit` raises `config.insecure_or_dangerous_flags` for each enabled known insecure/dangerous debug switch (one finding per flag). Keep these unset in production. If audit suppressions are configured, `security.audit.suppressions.active` stays in the active output even when matching findings move to `suppressedFindings`.

## Deployment and host trust

- Full-disk encryption on the gateway host; prefer a dedicated OS user account for the Gateway if the host is shared.
- Published package dependency lock: source checkouts use `pnpm-lock.yaml`; the published `openclaw` npm package and OpenClaw-owned npm plugin packages include `npm-shrinkwrap.json` so installs use the reviewed transitive dependency graph from the release instead of resolving a fresh graph at install time. This is a supply-chain hardening and release reproducibility boundary, not a sandbox - see [npm shrinkwrap](/gateway/security/shrinkwrap).
- Secure file operations: OpenClaw uses `@openclaw/fs-safe` for root-bounded file access, atomic writes, archive extraction, temp workspaces, and secret-file helpers. Optional native acceleration defaults **off**; set `OPENCLAW_FS_SAFE_NATIVE_MODE=auto` to use an installed platform binding or `require` to fail closed when native support is unavailable. Details: [Secure file operations](/gateway/security/secure-file-operations).
- Shared Slack workspace risk: if everyone in Slack can message the bot, the core risk is delegated tool authority - any allowed sender can induce tool calls (`exec`, browser, network/file tools) within the agent's policy, prompt/content injection from one sender can affect shared state/devices/outputs, and if the shared agent has sensitive credentials/files, any allowed sender can potentially drive exfiltration via tool usage. Use separate agents/gateways with minimal tools for team workflows; keep personal-data agents private.
- Company-shared agent (acceptable pattern): fine when everyone using the agent is in the same trust boundary (for example one company team) and the agent is strictly business-scoped. Run it on a dedicated machine/VM/container, use a dedicated OS user + dedicated browser/profile/accounts, and do not sign that runtime into personal Apple/Google accounts or personal password-manager/browser profiles. Mixing personal and company identities on the same runtime collapses the separation and increases personal-data exposure risk.

## Secrets on disk

Assume anything under `~/.openclaw/` (or `$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/`) may contain secrets or private data:

| `$CODEX_HOME/**` or `~/.codex/**`              | Native Codex runtime state. The ordinary harness accesses it only with explicit `plugins.entries.codex.config.appServer.homeScope: "user"`. The separate supervision connection accesses it when its resolved home scope is `"user"`, which is the default for stdio or Unix when unset. Contains the native Codex account, config, plugins, and thread store. Supervision lists source metadata and keeps a continued Chat's canonical native branch and later turns on that connection; branching copies bounded persisted user and assistant history into an authenticated, model-locked OpenClaw Chat. Enable only for an owner-controlled Gateway. See [Codex harness](/plugins/codex-harness#share-threads-with-codex-desktop-and-cli) and [Codex supervision](/plugins/codex-supervision). |

### Credential storage map

Also useful for backup decisions:

- WhatsApp: `~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/<accountId>/creds.json`
- Telegram bot token: config/env or `channels.telegram.tokenFile` (regular file only; symlinks rejected)
- Discord bot token: config/env or SecretRef (env/file/exec providers)
- Slack tokens: config/env (`channels.slack.*`)
- Pairing allowlists: `~/.openclaw/credentials/<channel>-allowFrom.json` (default account) / `<channel>-<accountId>-allowFrom.json` (non-default accounts)
- Model auth profiles: `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/agent/openclaw-agent.sqlite` (`auth_profile_store`)
- MCP OAuth sessions: `~/.openclaw/state/openclaw.sqlite` (`mcp_oauth_stores`)
- Legacy OAuth import: `~/.openclaw/credentials/oauth.json`

Hardening: keep permissions tight (`700` on dirs, `600` on files); use full-disk encryption on the gateway host; prefer a dedicated OS user account if the host is shared.

### File permissions

- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`: `600` (user read/write only)
- `~/.openclaw`: `700` (user only)

`openclaw doctor` can warn and offer to tighten these.

### Workspace `.env` files

OpenClaw loads workspace-local `.env` files for agents and tools, but never lets them silently override gateway runtime controls:

- Provider credential environment variables are blocked from untrusted workspace `.env` files - for example `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, `BRAVE_API_KEY`, `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `EXA_API_KEY`, `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`, and provider auth keys declared by installed trusted plugins. Put provider credentials in the Gateway process environment, `~/.openclaw/.env` (`$OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR/.env`), the config `env` block, or an optional login-shell import instead.
- Any key starting with `OPENCLAW_` is blocked from untrusted workspace `.env` files, reserving the whole runtime namespace so a future `OPENCLAW_*` control is fail-closed by default rather than silently inheritable from checked-in or attacker-supplied `.env` content.
- Channel and provider endpoint-routing settings are also blocked from workspace `.env` overrides (for example `MATRIX_HOMESERVER`, `MATTERMOST_URL`, `IRC_HOST`, `SYNOLOGY_CHAT_INCOMING_URL`, `AZURE_SPEECH_ENDPOINT`, and other keys ending in `_ENDPOINT`), so a cloned workspace cannot redirect bundled connector traffic through local endpoint config. These must come from the gateway process environment, global runtime dotenv, explicit config, or `env.shellEnv`.
- Trusted process/OS environment variables, global runtime dotenv, config `env`, and enabled login-shell import still apply - this only constrains workspace `.env` file loading.

Workspace `.env` files frequently live next to agent code, get committed by accident, or get written by tools; blocking provider credentials prevents a cloned workspace from substituting attacker-controlled provider accounts.

### Logs and transcripts

OpenClaw stores session transcripts on disk under `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl` for session continuity and optional memory indexing - any process/user with filesystem access can read them. Treat disk access as the trust boundary and lock down `~/.openclaw` permissions; run agents under separate OS users or hosts for stronger isolation.

Gateway logs may include tool summaries, errors, and URLs; session transcripts can include pasted secrets, file contents, command output, and links.

- Log/transcript redaction is always on and cannot be disabled by config.
- Add custom patterns for your environment via `logging.redactPatterns` (tokens, hostnames, internal URLs).
- When sharing diagnostics, prefer `openclaw status --all` (pasteable, secrets redacted) over raw logs.
- Prune old session transcripts and log files if you do not need long retention.

Details: [Logging](/gateway/logging)

## Secure baseline (copy/paste)

```json5
{
  gateway: {
    mode: "local",
    bind: "loopback",
    port: 18789,
    auth: { mode: "token", token: "your-long-random-token" },
  },
  channels: {
    whatsapp: {
      dmPolicy: "pairing",
      groups: { "*": { requireMention: true } },
    },
  },
}
```

Keeps the Gateway private, requires DM pairing, and avoids always-on group bots. For safer tool execution too, add a sandbox + deny dangerous tools for any non-owner agent (see "Per-agent access profiles" above).

### Separate numbers (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram)

For phone-number-based channels, consider running the assistant on a separate number from your personal one, so personal conversations stay private and the bot number handles automation with its own boundaries.

## Incident response

### Contain

1. Stop it: stop the macOS app (if it supervises the Gateway) or terminate your `openclaw gateway` process.
2. Close exposure: set `gateway.bind: "loopback"` (or disable Tailscale Funnel/Serve) until you understand what happened.
3. Freeze access: switch risky DMs/groups to `dmPolicy: "disabled"` / require mentions, and remove any `"*"` allow-all entries.

### Rotate (assume compromise if secrets leaked)

1. Rotate Gateway auth (`gateway.auth.token` / `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PASSWORD`) and restart.
2. Rotate remote client secrets (`gateway.remote.token` / `.password`) on any machine that can call the Gateway.
3. Rotate provider/API credentials (WhatsApp creds, Slack/Discord tokens, model/API keys in `auth-profiles.json`, and encrypted secrets payload values when used).

### Audit

1. Check Gateway logs with `openclaw logs` (or `openclaw --profile <profile> logs` for a named profile). The default path is `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-YYYY-MM-DD.log`; named profiles use `/tmp/openclaw/openclaw-<profile>-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, unless `logging.file` overrides it.
2. Review the relevant transcript(s): `~/.openclaw/agents/<agentId>/sessions/*.jsonl`.
3. Review recent config changes that could have widened access: `gateway.bind`, `gateway.auth`, DM/group policies, `tools.elevated`, plugin changes.
4. Re-run `openclaw security audit --deep` and confirm critical findings are resolved.

### Collect for a report

- Timestamp, gateway host OS + OpenClaw version.
- The session transcript(s) + a short log tail (after redacting).
- What the attacker sent and what the agent did.
- Whether the Gateway was exposed beyond loopback (LAN/Tailscale Funnel/Serve).

## Secret scanning

CI runs the pre-commit `detect-private-key` hook over the repository. If it fails, remove or rotate the committed key material, then reproduce locally:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files detect-private-key
```
