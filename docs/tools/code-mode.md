Code mode is an experimental OpenClaw agent-runtime feature. It defaults to the
`"auto"` tier, which engages only models whose catalog marks them as preferred
code-mode performers; every other model keeps normal tool exposure. When
engaged, the model no longer sees every enabled tool schema; instead, it sees
`exec`, `wait`, and any direct-only tool whose structured result cannot cross
the JSON-only guest bridge. The model writes a small JavaScript or TypeScript
program that searches, describes, and calls the hidden tool catalog.

This page documents OpenClaw code mode, not Codex Code Mode. The two features
share a name and the same control-tool names (`exec`, `wait`), but they are
separate implementations:

- Codex Code Mode runs inside the Codex coding harness. Its `exec` tool is a
  freeform-grammar tool: the model writes raw JavaScript source (optionally
  prefixed by a `// @exec: {...}` pragma line for execution options), executed
  in Codex's in-process V8 Code Mode runtime.
- OpenClaw code mode runs in the generic OpenClaw agent runtime, gated by
  `tools.codeMode.enabled` (default `"auto"`, per-model activation). Its `exec`
  tool takes a JSON `{ code, language }` payload, executed in a QuickJS-WASI
  worker.

Both are JavaScript execution surfaces, not shell-command surfaces. Treat them
as independent, differently-implemented features that happen to expose
identically-named `exec`/`wait` tools.

In OpenClaw code mode, `command` is a JavaScript or TypeScript alias for
`code`, not a shell command. For shell or file operations, call the appropriate
catalog tool from guest JavaScript with `tools.callValue`. Recognizable shell
commands are rejected before the QuickJS worker starts with actionable
`invalid_input` guidance.

## What it does

- The model-visible tool list becomes `exec`, `wait`, plus any direct-only tool
  such as `computer` or the native-vision `image` loader whose image result
  cannot survive the guest bridge.
- `exec` evaluates model-generated JavaScript or TypeScript in an isolated
  QuickJS-WASI worker thread.
- Every catalog-eligible enabled tool (OpenClaw core, plugin, MCP, client) is hidden as a
  standalone model tool and exposed inside the guest program through `ALL_TOOLS`
  and `tools`.
- The `exec` description carries a bounded quick index of exact OpenClaw/plugin
  catalog ids, compact input hints, and compact declared output hints when a
  trusted tool provides an output schema. It omits descriptions, full schemas,
  MCP entries, and overflow entries; guest-side catalog lookup remains the fallback.
- Guest code searches the hidden catalog, describes a tool's schema, and calls
  a tool through the same execution path used by normal agent turns (policy,
  approvals, hooks, telemetry all still apply).
- MCP tools are grouped under the `MCP` namespace; in code mode this is the
  only supported way to call them.
- `wait` resumes a suspended code-mode run when nested tool calls are still
  pending.

Code mode changes the model-facing orchestration surface only. It does not
replace tools, plugin tools, MCP tools, auth, approval policy, channel
behavior, or model selection.

## Why use it

- Smaller prompt surface: providers get two control tools, a bounded native-tool
  index, and only the few required direct tools instead of dozens or hundreds
  of full tool schemas.
- Better orchestration: the model can use loops, joins, small transforms,
  conditional logic, and parallel nested tool calls inside one code cell.
- Fewer model round trips: a declared output contract lets the model call and
  transform a tool result in one `exec`; unknown outputs remain raw-first.
- Provider neutral: works for OpenClaw, plugin, MCP, and client tools without
  depending on provider-native code execution.
- Fails closed: if code mode is enabled but the QuickJS-WASI runtime is
  unavailable, the run fails instead of silently falling back to broad direct
  tool exposure.

Most useful for agents with a large enabled tool catalog, or workflows where
the model needs to search, combine, and call several tools before answering.

Keep direct tool exposure for a small catalog or a model that does not reliably
write short programs. Use [Tool Search](/tools/tool-search) when you want a
compact catalog but prefer structured search/describe/call controls instead of
the QuickJS-WASI guest.

## Quickstart

### Defaults and overrides

Code mode ships enabled in the `"auto"` tier: it engages only when the run's
model is flagged as a preferred code-mode performer in its provider catalog,
and every other model keeps normal tool exposure. No configuration is needed.
See [Automatic per-model activation](#automatic-per-model-activation) for the
exact semantics and the shipped model list.

To opt out for every run:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    codeMode: false,
  },
}
```

To force code mode on for every tool-capable run, regardless of model:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    codeMode: true,
  },
}
```

Object form works too: `tools.codeMode.enabled` accepts the same `false`,
`true`, and `"auto"` values. An object without `enabled` keeps the `"auto"`
default.

If you use sandboxed agents with configured MCP servers, also allow the
bundled MCP plugin in the sandbox tool policy, for example
`tools.sandbox.tools.alsoAllow: ["bundle-mcp"]`. See
[Configuration - tools and custom providers](/gateway/config-tools#mcp-and-plugin-tools-inside-sandbox-tool-policy).

Set explicit limits for tighter bounds:

```json5
{
  tools: {
    codeMode: {
      enabled: true,
      timeoutMs: 10000,
      memoryLimitBytes: 67108864,
      maxOutputBytes: 65536,
      maxSnapshotBytes: 10485760,
      maxPendingToolCalls: 16,
      snapshotTtlSeconds: 900,
      searchDefaultLimit: 8,
      maxSearchLimit: 50,
    },
  },
}
```

### What the model does

For a tool with a declared output such as
`Array<{ id: string; paid: boolean; tons: number }>`, one guest program can
select, call, and transform it:

```javascript
const [shipmentTool] = await tools.search("list shipments");
const shipments = await tools.callValue(shipmentTool.id, {});
return shipments.filter((shipment) => !shipment.paid && shipment.tons > 10);
```

When a quick-index line ends in `-> ?`, the output shape is unknown. The first
`exec` must return `await tools.callValue(...)` unchanged. A later `exec` can
transform the observed value. This costs an extra model turn, but prevents the
model from guessing field names.

### Verify the active surface

To confirm the model payload shape while debugging, run the Gateway with
targeted logging:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_CODE_MODE=1 \
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_TRANSPORT=1 \
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_PAYLOAD=tools \
openclaw gateway
```

With code mode active, the logged model-facing tool names should be `exec` and
`wait`. For the full redacted provider payload, add
`OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_PAYLOAD=full-redacted` for a short debugging session.

## Use Swarm for agent fan-out

[Swarm](/tools/swarm) adds `agents.run()`, `phase()`, and `log()` guest globals
for orchestrating concurrent sub-agents from Code Mode scripts. Enable both
`tools.codeMode` and `tools.swarm`, then use normal JavaScript control flow for
fan-out, decision gates, and structured collection. Swarm is a separate opt-in
gate; enabling Code Mode alone does not expose the `agents.*` API.

## Technical tour

The rest of this page covers the runtime contract and implementation details,
for maintainers, plugin authors debugging tool exposure, and operators
validating high-risk deployments.

## Scope

Code mode owns the model-facing orchestration shape for a prepared run. It
does not own model selection, channel behavior, auth, tool policy, or tool
implementations.

In scope: model-visible control/direct tool definitions, hidden tool catalog
construction, JavaScript/TypeScript guest execution, the QuickJS-WASI worker
runtime, host callbacks for search/describe/call, resumable state for
suspended guest programs, output/timeout/memory/pending-call/snapshot limits,
and telemetry/trajectory projection for nested tool calls.

Out of scope: provider-native remote code execution, shell execution
semantics, changing existing tool authorization, persistent user-authored
scripts, package manager/file/network/module access in guest code, and direct
reuse of Codex Code Mode internals.

Provider-owned tools such as remote Python sandboxes are separate tools. See
[Code execution](/tools/code-execution).

## Terms

- **Code mode**: the OpenClaw runtime mode that hides catalog-compatible model
  tools and exposes `exec`, `wait`, plus required direct-only tools.
- **Guest runtime**: the QuickJS-WASI JavaScript VM that evaluates model code.
- **Host bridge**: the narrow JSON-compatible callback surface from guest code
  back into OpenClaw.
- **Catalog**: the run-scoped list of effective tools after normal tool
  policy, plugin, MCP, and client-tool resolution.
- **Nested tool call**: a tool call made from guest code through the host
  bridge.
- **Snapshot**: serialized QuickJS-WASI VM state saved so `wait` can continue
  a suspended code-mode run.

## Configuration

`tools.codeMode.enabled` is the activation gate; setting other fields does not
enable the feature on its own.

If code mode is enabled but QuickJS-WASI cannot load, OpenClaw fails closed
for that run; it does not silently expose normal tools as a fallback. This
holds for `true` and for `"auto"` runs where the model resolves as preferred:
an engaged run never silently falls back to broad direct tool exposure.

## Automatic per-model activation

`tools.codeMode.enabled` accepts three values:

- `"auto"` (default): code mode engages only when the run's model is flagged
  as a preferred code-mode performer in its provider catalog.
- `false`: code mode is off for every run.
- `true`: code mode engages for every tool-capable run, regardless of model.

`false` and `true` are absolute overrides and behave exactly as before the
`"auto"` tier existed.

### The `compat.codeMode` catalog flag

Provider catalogs can tier a model with `compat.codeMode` on its model entry,
next to flags like `compat.supportsTools`:

- `"preferred"`: the model reliably writes short orchestration programs and
  benefits from the compact code-mode surface; `"auto"` engages code mode.
- `"capable"` (or absent): the model can run code mode when forced with
  `enabled: true`, but `"auto"` keeps normal tool exposure.

Models without tool support cannot use code mode at all; there is no separate
"unsupported" tier. The flag is capability metadata owned by the provider
plugin's catalog; core only reads the generic compat field.

### Shipped preferred models

Bundled provider catalogs currently flag these models as `"preferred"`:

| Provider  | Models                                                                                                                                       |

| google    | `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.6-flash` |

Everything else, including all Ollama-served local models, stays unflagged and
keeps normal tool exposure under `"auto"`.

### Models shipped by more than one provider

Several vendors are reachable through more than one provider id: a subscription
endpoint next to an API endpoint, or a gateway that resells another vendor's
model. Because `"auto"` resolves the tier from whichever catalog served the run,
two catalogs describing the same upstream model must not disagree by accident.

Every catalog row for a shared model therefore states its tier explicitly once
any sibling row states one. Rows are matched on the vendor's own name for the
weights, so a catalog that republishes a model under a namespaced id or
different casing is matched automatically: `novita/moonshotai/kimi-k3`,
`nvidia/z-ai/glm-5.2`, and `together/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro` all group with
the first-party rows without anyone declaring anything. Only genuinely different
names need the manifest's `upstreamModel` marker, as the `kimi` catalog uses for
`moonshot/kimi-k3`.

Reseller and aggregator catalogs such as `baseten`, `deepinfra`,
`github-copilot`, `gmi`, `novita`, `nvidia`, `ollama-cloud`, `opencode`,
`opencode-go`, `qianfan`, `together`, `venice`, and `volcengine-plan` currently
declare `"capable"` for the models first-party catalogs flag `"preferred"`: the
preferred tier came from evaluations on the first-party endpoints, and those
runs have not been repeated per reseller. Promoting one of those rows is a
deliberate, evidence-backed change rather than an oversight.

For OpenAI models, the flag matters only when the run resolves to the OpenClaw
embedded agent runtime. Default OpenAI routing uses the Codex-style harness
surface, where OpenClaw code mode does not apply; the catalog flag never
changes that routing decision.

### Choosing when to enable

In A/B evaluations on the preferred models above, code mode reduced total
token usage by roughly 30-50% at equal-or-better task pass rates, mostly by
replacing many full tool schemas and per-tool round trips with one compact
program surface. Models below the preferred tier showed no consistent win and
sometimes regressed, which is why `"auto"` leaves them on direct tools.

The default `"auto"` fits agents that switch between models: strong models get
the compact surface, weaker or local ones keep the exposure they handle best.
Use `true`
when you have verified a specific unflagged model performs well with code
mode; global force-on is most predictable for single-model deployments. For
open-weight or uncached serving where every prompt token is billed or
recomputed, prefer enabling per model (via `"auto"` or a per-agent override)
rather than globally, since the token savings depend on the model actually
using the program surface well.

## Activation

Code mode is evaluated after the effective tool policy is known and before the
final model request is assembled:

1. Resolve the agent, model, provider, sandbox, channel, sender, and run
   policy.
2. Build the effective OpenClaw tool list, adding eligible plugin, MCP, and
   client tools.
3. Apply allow/deny policy.
4. If `tools.codeMode.enabled` is `false`, or is `"auto"` and the run's model
   is not catalog-preferred, continue with normal tool exposure.
5. If enabled and tools are active for the run, retain required direct-only
   tools and register every catalog-eligible effective tool in the code-mode
   catalog.
6. Remove the cataloged tools from the model-visible list; add `exec` and
   `wait` alongside the retained direct-only tools.

Runs that intentionally have no tools (raw model calls, `disableTools: true`,
or an empty `tools.allow` list) do not activate the code-mode surface even
when `tools.codeMode.enabled: true` is configured. Code mode and OpenClaw Tool
Search are mutually exclusive for a run; if code mode activates, Tool Search's
compaction does not.

The code-mode catalog is run-scoped and must not leak tools from another
agent, session, sender, or run.

## Model-visible tools

When code mode is active, the model sees `exec`, `wait`, and any required
direct-only tool. Every other enabled tool is hidden from the model-facing
tool list and registered in the code-mode catalog.

Use `exec` for tool orchestration, data joining, loops, parallel nested calls,
and structured transforms. Use `wait` only when `exec` returns a resumable
`waiting` result.

## `exec`

`exec` starts a code-mode cell and returns one result. Input code is model
generated and must be treated as hostile.

Input:

```typescript
type CodeModeExecInput = {
  code?: string;
  command?: string;
  language?: "javascript" | "typescript";
};
```

Rules:

- One of `code` or `command` must be non-empty.
- `code` is the documented model-facing field.
- `command` is accepted as an exec-compatible alias for hook policies and
  trusted rewrites (the normal OpenClaw shell exec tool also uses a `command`
  field); when both are present, the values must match.
- `language` defaults to `"javascript"`; the schema exposes it as a flat
  string enum (`"javascript" | "typescript"`), not a `oneOf`/`anyOf` union,
  since some providers reject those shapes.
- If `language` is `"typescript"`, OpenClaw transpiles before evaluation.
- `exec` rejects `import`, `require`, dynamic import, and module-loader
  patterns.
- `exec` never exposes the normal shell `exec` implementation recursively.
- Outer code-mode `exec` hook events carry `toolKind: "code_mode_exec"` and
  `toolInputKind: "javascript" | "typescript"` (when known), so policies can
  distinguish code-mode cells from shell-style `exec` calls that share the
  same tool name.

Result:

```typescript
type CodeModeResult = CodeModeCompletedResult | CodeModeWaitingResult | CodeModeFailedResult;

type CodeModeCompletedResult = {
  status: "completed";
  value: unknown;
  output?: CodeModeOutput[];
  telemetry: CodeModeTelemetry;
};

type CodeModeWaitingResult = {
  status: "waiting";
  runId: string;
  reason: "pending_tools" | "yield";
  pendingToolCalls?: CodeModePendingToolCall[];
  output?: CodeModeOutput[];
  telemetry: CodeModeTelemetry;
};

type CodeModeFailedResult = {
  status: "failed";
  error: string;
  code?: CodeModeErrorCode;
  output?: CodeModeOutput[];
  telemetry: CodeModeTelemetry;
};
```

`exec` returns `waiting` when the guest suspends with resumable state that still
needs a model-visible continuation — an explicit `yield_control(...)`, or a
bridge tool call that has not resolved within the exec deadline. The result
includes a `runId` for `wait`. Bridge tool calls — `tools.search`/`describe`/
`call` and namespace calls, including MCP namespace calls — are auto-drained
inside the same `exec`/`wait` call while they resolve within the deadline, so a
compact code block that awaits several tools runs to completion in one model
turn instead of forcing one model tool call per await. Restart-safe runs never
auto-drain; their pending work still goes through the replay-safe checks.

`exec` returns `completed` only when the guest VM has no pending work and the
final value is JSON-compatible after OpenClaw's output adapter runs.

## `wait`

`wait` continues a suspended code-mode VM.

Input:

```typescript
type CodeModeWaitInput = {
  runId: string;
};
```

Output is the same `CodeModeResult` union returned by `exec`.

`wait` exists because nested OpenClaw tools can be slow, interactive, approval
gated, or stream partial updates; the model should not need to keep one long
`exec` call open while the host waits for external work.

QuickJS-WASI snapshot/restore is the resume mechanism:

1. `exec` evaluates code until completion, failure, or suspension.
2. On suspension, OpenClaw snapshots the QuickJS VM and records pending host
   work.
3. When pending work settles, `wait` restores the VM snapshot and
   re-registers host callbacks by stable names.
4. OpenClaw delivers nested tool results into the restored VM and drains
   QuickJS pending jobs.
5. `wait` returns `completed`, `failed`, or another `waiting` result.

Snapshots are runtime state, not user artifacts: they live only in an
in-process map (no database or disk write), are size-limited, expire, and are
scoped to the run and session that created them.

`wait` fails (as a `failed` result) when:

- `runId` is unknown or its snapshot already expired.
- the caller is not in the same run/session scope as the suspended run.
- a `wait` is already in flight for that `runId`.
- QuickJS-WASI restore fails.
- resuming would exceed `maxOutputBytes` or `maxSnapshotBytes`.

```typescript
declare const ALL_TOOLS: ToolCatalogEntry[];
declare const tools: ToolCatalog;
declare const MCP: Record<string, unknown>;
declare const namespaces: Record<string, unknown>;

declare function text(value: unknown): void;
declare function json(value: unknown): void;
declare function sleep(ms: number): Promise<void>;
declare function yield_control(reason?: string): Promise<void>;
```

`sleep(ms)` pauses guest execution for `ms` milliseconds. The bound is capped at
8,000ms (8 seconds) to stay within the default execution deadline. Use
`await sleep(n)` between tool calls that need wall-clock time to settle — for
example, after writing to a terminal session before reading its output. Under normal execution with sufficient remaining deadline, the pause resolves
inline within the same `exec` auto-drain loop with no extra model round-trip.
Replay-safe runs skip inline draining and return `waiting`; callers may need a
`wait` tool call to collect the settled result.

`ALL_TOOLS` is compact metadata for the run-scoped catalog; it does not contain
full schemas by default. The model-visible `exec` description also includes a
bounded, deterministic subset of exact OpenClaw/plugin ids, compact input
hints, and trusted declared output hints. Descriptions remain deferred so
adversarial catalog prose cannot steer the model. When that index omits a tool,
read `ALL_TOOLS` or call `tools.search(...)` inside the guest program.

The arrow in each quick-index line describes the `tools.callValue(...)` value.
`-> Array<{ id: string }>` is a declared output hint; `-> ?` is output unknown.
Unknown outputs stay raw-first: return the value unchanged, observe it, then
filter or map it in a later `exec` instead of guessing field names. This also
applies when a declared-output read feeds a final `-> ?` call: return that
call's raw value without wrapping it in the requested answer shape.

```typescript
type ToolCatalogEntry = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  label?: string;
  description: string;
  source: "openclaw" | "mcp" | "client";
  sourceName?: string;
  input: string;
  output?: string;
};
```

`input` is a bounded TypeScript-style signature for the common case. Use
`tools.describe(...)` when the exact full schema is still needed. Remote MCP
and client entries use `input: "unknown"` so their untrusted schemas stay
deferred until `describe`. `output` is
present only for a complete compact hint derived from a trusted OpenClaw core
or plugin `outputSchema`. MCP and client output-schema claims are not promoted
into this trusted catalog hint.

Plugin tools use `source: "openclaw"` with `sourceName` set to the owning
plugin id; there is no separate `"plugin"` source value. `source: "mcp"` is
used only for MCP entries in `sourceName`/`mcp` metadata (and is filtered out
of `ALL_TOOLS`/`tools.*`, see below).

Full schema is loaded only on demand:

```typescript
type ToolCatalogEntryWithSchema = ToolCatalogEntry & {
  parameters: unknown;
  outputSchema?: unknown;
};
```

Catalog helpers:

```typescript
type ToolCatalog = {
  search(query: string, options?: { limit?: number }): Promise<ToolCatalogEntry[]>;
  describe(id: string): Promise<ToolCatalogEntryWithSchema>;
  callValue(id: string, input?: unknown): Promise<unknown>;
  call(id: string, input?: unknown): Promise<unknown>;
  [safeToolName: string]: unknown;
};
```

Paired Gateway nodes are available through the `nodes` global:

```typescript
const available = await nodes.list();
const node = await nodes.get(available[0].id);
const status = await node.invoke("device.status");
```

`nodes.list()` returns paired node ids, names, platforms, connection state, and
advertised commands. `nodes.get(idOrName)` resolves an exact id before a display
name and returns a handle with `id`, `name`, and `invoke(command, params?)`.
Invocation uses the normal `nodes` tool path, so pairing, command policy, scopes,
approvals, timeouts, hooks, and telemetry are unchanged. A handle includes
`listDir(path)` only when the node advertises `fs.listDir`. It does not include
`exec`: the generic nodes surface reserves `system.run` for the normal shell
`exec` tool with a node host.

Convenience tool functions are installed only for unambiguous safe names:

```typescript
const files = await tools.search("read local file");
const fileRead = await tools.describe(files[0].id);
const content = await tools.callValue(fileRead.id, { path: "README.md" });

// If the hidden catalog has an unambiguous `web_search` entry:
const hits = await tools.web_search({ query: "OpenClaw code mode" });
```

`tools.callValue(...)` returns a normal tool's JSON `details` value directly.
`tools.call(...)` preserves the raw `{ tool, result }` envelope for callers
that need content blocks or other result metadata.

## Declared output contracts

OpenClaw tools can declare `outputSchema` for the structured value placed in
`AgentToolResult.details`. This is useful for Code Mode and Tool Search; it is
not a provider-native tool response schema and does not change direct tool
exposure.

For a tool made with `defineToolPlugin`, declare the schema beside
`parameters`:

```typescript
import { Type } from "typebox";
import { defineToolPlugin } from "openclaw/plugin-sdk/tool-plugin";

const Shipment = Type.Object(
  {
    id: Type.String(),
    paid: Type.Boolean(),
    tons: Type.Number(),
  },
  { additionalProperties: false },
);

export default defineToolPlugin({
  id: "shipping",
  name: "Shipping",
  description: "Shipment tools.",
  tools: (tool) => [
    tool({
      name: "shipping_list",
      description: "List shipments.",
      parameters: Type.Object({}),
      outputSchema: Type.Array(Shipment),
      execute: async () => loadShipments(),
    }),
  ],
});
```

For `api.registerTool(...)` or a factory tool, put the same `outputSchema`
property on the returned `AnyAgentTool` object.

Current built-in contracts include `agents_list`, `apply_patch`,
`conversations_list`, `conversations_send`, `conversations_turn`, `edit`,
`openclaw`, `read`, `screen`,
`sessions_history`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_search`, `sessions_send`,
`session_status`, `spawn_task`, `terminal`, `web_fetch`, and `web_search`.
Exact passthroughs can reuse their owning protocol schema instead of
duplicating a model-only contract. For example, the conversation tools expose
the same Gateway result schemas used by `conversations.list`,
`conversations.send`, and `conversations.turn`; `web_fetch` owns a tool-local
schema whose hint exposes stable metadata, text, cache state, and nested spill
metadata; `web_search` declares its exact normalized results/answer/error/raw
union as a complete quick-index hint. Filesystem contracts return structured
read text, image, truncation, and optional-not-found outcomes; explicit edit
change state plus diff/patch data; and apply-patch path summaries. When the
quick index declares the fields, one cell can compose discovery and delivery
without a separate inspection turn:

```javascript
const listed = await tools.conversations_list({ query: "build bot" });
const target = listed.conversations.find((item) => item.label === "Build bot");
if (!target) throw new Error("conversation not found");
return await tools.conversations_send({
  conversationRef: target.conversationRef,
  message: "Build finished.",
});
```

The nested calls still use normal tool policy, hooks, and approvals. If a full
contract is exact but too large for the bounded quick index, it remains
available through `tools.describe(...)` and the arrow stays `-> ?`.

The contract rules are strict:

- Describe the exact JSON-compatible `details` value, not rendered `content`
  blocks or a provider envelope.
- Include every non-throwing success or error variant. Omit `outputSchema` when
  the tool has no stable structured result.
- Close object layers with `{ additionalProperties: false }` for a complete
  quick-index hint. Open, oversized, or otherwise partial schemas stay
  available through `tools.describe(...)` but do not enable one-turn field use.
- OpenClaw compiles the schema before running the tool, then validates final
  `details` after normal tool hooks and before a catalog call returns. An
  invalid schema cannot run the tool; a mismatch fails without printing the
  value.
- Compact hints are deterministic and bounded. `tools.describe(...)` exposes
  the full trusted schema when the compact hint is insufficient.
- Installed plugin code is already trusted local code. Remote MCP and client
  metadata remains untrusted and cannot opt into these quick-index hints.

See [Tool plugins](/plugins/tool-plugins#output-contracts) for plugin authoring
details.

MCP catalog entries are not callable through `tools.callValue(...)`,
`tools.call(...)`, or convenience functions in code mode; they are exposed
only through the generated `MCP` namespace. TypeScript-style declaration files
are available through the read-only `API` virtual file surface, so agents can
inspect MCP signatures without adding MCP schemas to the prompt:

```typescript
const files = await API.list("mcp");
const githubApi = await API.read("mcp/github.d.ts");

const issue = await MCP.github.createIssue({
  owner: "openclaw",
  repo: "openclaw",
  title: "Investigate gateway logs",
});

const snapshot = await MCP.chromeDevtools.takeSnapshot({ output: "markdown" });
const resource = await MCP.docs.resources.read({ uri: "memo://one" });
const prompt = await MCP.docs.prompts.get({
  name: "brief",
  arguments: { topic: "release" },
});
```

`API.read("mcp/<server>.d.ts")` returns compact declarations inferred from MCP
tool metadata:

```typescript
type McpToolResult = {
  content?: unknown[];
  structuredContent?: unknown;
  isError?: boolean;
  [key: string]: unknown;
};

declare namespace MCP.github {
  /** Return this TypeScript-style API header. */
  function $api(toolName?: string, options?: { schema?: boolean }): Promise<McpApiHeader>;

  /**
   * Create a GitHub issue.
   * @param owner Repository owner
   * @param repo Repository name
   * @param title Issue title
   */
  function createIssue(input: {
    owner: string;
    repo: string;
    title: string;
    body?: string;
  }): Promise<McpToolResult>;
}
```

Declaration files are virtual, not written under the workspace or state
directory. For each code-mode `exec` call, OpenClaw builds the run-scoped tool
catalog, keeps the visible MCP entries, renders `mcp/index.d.ts` plus one
`mcp/<server>.d.ts` per visible server, and injects that small read-only table
into the QuickJS worker. Guest code sees only the `API` object:
`API.list(prefix?)` returns file metadata and `API.read(path)` returns the
selected declaration content. Unknown paths and `.`/`..` segments are
rejected.

This keeps large MCP schemas out of the model prompt: the agent learns the
virtual API exists from the `exec` tool description, reads only the needed
declaration file, then calls `MCP.<server>.<tool>()` with one object argument.
`MCP.<server>.$api()` remains available as an inline fallback for a
single-tool schema response inside the program.

The guest runtime never sees host objects directly. Inputs and outputs cross
the bridge as JSON-compatible values with explicit size caps.

## Output API

- `text(value)` appends human-readable output to the `output` array.
- `json(value)` appends a structured output item after JSON-compatible
  serialization.
- The guest code's final returned value becomes `value` in a `completed`
  result.

```typescript
type CodeModeOutput = { type: "text"; text: string } | { type: "json"; value: unknown };
```

Rules: output order matches guest calls; output is capped by
`maxOutputBytes`; non-serializable values are converted to plain strings or
errors; binary values are not supported. Images and files travel through
ordinary OpenClaw tools, not through the code-mode bridge.

## Tool catalog

The hidden catalog includes tools after effective policy filtering, in this
order: OpenClaw core tools, bundled plugin tools, external plugin tools, MCP
tools, then client-provided tools for the current run.

Catalog ids are stable within one run and deterministic across equivalent
tool sets when possible. Actual shape:

```text
<source>:<owner>:<tool-name>
```

where `<source>` is `openclaw`, `mcp`, or `client` (plugin tools use
`openclaw` with the plugin id as `<owner>`; core tools use `openclaw:core:*`).
Examples:

```text
openclaw:core:message
openclaw:browser:browser_request
mcp:github:create_issue
client:app:select_file
```

The catalog omits code-mode control tools (`exec`, `wait`, `tool_search_code`,
`tool_search`, `tool_describe`, `tool_call`) and direct-only tools. Controls
must not recurse through the catalog; direct-only tools remain model-visible
because their structured results cannot cross the QuickJS bridge.

MCP entries stay in the run-scoped catalog so policy, approvals, hooks,
telemetry, transcript projection, and exact tool ids remain shared with
normal tool execution. The guest-facing `ALL_TOOLS`, `tools.search(...)`,
`tools.describe(...)`, `tools.callValue(...)`, and `tools.call(...)` views omit MCP entries. The
generated `MCP.<server>.<tool>({ ...input })` namespace resolves back to the
exact catalog id and dispatches through the same executor path.

## Tool Search interaction

Code mode supersedes the OpenClaw Tool Search model surface for runs where it
is active.

When `tools.codeMode.enabled` is true and code mode activates:

- OpenClaw does not expose `tool_search_code`, `tool_search`, `tool_describe`,
  or `tool_call` as model-visible tools.
- The same cataloging idea moves inside the guest runtime.
- The guest runtime receives compact `ALL_TOOLS` metadata and search/describe/
  call helpers for non-MCP tools.
- MCP calls use the generated `MCP` namespace and its `$api()` headers instead
  of `tools.call(...)`.
- Nested calls dispatch through the same OpenClaw executor path that Tool
  Search uses.

See [Tool Search](/tools/tool-search) for the OpenClaw compact catalog bridge
that code mode supersedes for active runs.

## Tool names and collisions

The model-visible `exec` tool is the code-mode tool. If the normal OpenClaw
shell `exec` tool is enabled, it is hidden from the model and cataloged like
any other tool.

Inside the guest runtime:

- `tools.call("openclaw:core:exec", input)` can call the shell exec tool if
  policy allows it.
- `tools.exec(...)` is installed only if the shell exec catalog entry has an
  unambiguous safe name.
- the code-mode `exec` tool is never recursively available through `tools`.

If two tools normalize to the same safe convenience name, OpenClaw omits the
convenience function and requires `tools.call(id, input)`.

## Nested tool execution

Every nested tool call crosses the host bridge and re-enters OpenClaw,
preserving: active agent id, session id and key, sender and channel context,
sandbox policy, approval policy, plugin `before_tool_call` hooks, abort
signal, streaming updates where available, and trajectory/audit events.

Nested calls project into the transcript as real tool calls so support
bundles show what happened, with the projection identifying the parent
code-mode tool call and the nested tool id.

Parallel nested calls are allowed up to `maxPendingToolCalls`.

## Run and snapshot lifecycle

Each code-mode run is tracked in an in-process map keyed by `runId` (not
persisted to disk or a database). `exec`/`wait` return one of three result
statuses: `completed`, `waiting`, or `failed`.

- A `waiting` result stores the QuickJS snapshot, pending bridge requests, and
  scoping metadata (agent run id, session id/key) until `wait` resumes it or
  it expires.
- Expiry, wrong-session, wrong-run, and unknown/already-resuming `runId`
  values do not produce a distinct terminal status; they surface as a
  `failed` result (`code: "invalid_input"`) with a message such as `code mode
run is unavailable or expired.` or `code mode run belongs to a different
session.`.
- A run's snapshot is removed from the map as soon as it settles to
  `completed` or `failed`, or is dropped on Gateway shutdown (nothing
  survives a restart: this is transient runtime state).
- For read-only work, `exec` can set `restartSafe: true`. OpenClaw then rejects
  side-effecting catalog and namespace tool calls before execution and
  marks suspended results as replay-safe. If a restart interrupts `wait`,
  [restart recovery](/gateway/restart-recovery) reconstructs the turn from the
  transcript instead of restoring the process-local snapshot. The recovery
  turn itself remains limited to audited read-only core tools and explicitly
  replay-safe plugin tools.
- OpenClaw caps the number of concurrently suspended runs per process (64) and
  rejects new suspensions past that cap with `too many suspended code mode
runs.`.

Snapshot storage is bounded by `maxSnapshotBytes` per run, the per-process
suspended-run cap above, and `snapshotTtlSeconds`.

## QuickJS-WASI runtime

OpenClaw loads `quickjs-wasi` as a direct dependency in the owning package; it
does not rely on a transitive copy installed for an unrelated dependency.

Runtime responsibilities: compile/load the QuickJS-WASI WebAssembly module;
create one isolated VM per code-mode run or resume; register host callbacks
by stable names; set memory and interrupt limits; evaluate JavaScript; drain
pending jobs; snapshot suspended VM state; restore snapshots for `wait`;
dispose VM handles and snapshots after terminal states.

The runtime executes in a Node.js worker thread, outside OpenClaw's main
event loop. A guest infinite loop must not block the Gateway process
indefinitely; the worker's interrupt handler enforces the wall-clock timeout
independent of guest code cooperating.

## TypeScript

TypeScript support is a source transform only: accepted input is one
TypeScript code string; output is a JavaScript string evaluated by
QuickJS-WASI. There is no typechecking, no module resolution, and no
`import`/`require`. Diagnostics are returned as `failed` results.

The TypeScript compiler is loaded lazily only for TypeScript cells; plain
JavaScript cells and disabled code mode never load it.

## Security boundary

Model code is hostile. The runtime uses defense in depth:

- runs QuickJS-WASI outside the main event loop, in a worker thread
- loads `quickjs-wasi` as a direct dependency, not through Codex or a
  transitive package
- no filesystem, network, subprocess, module import, environment variables,
  or host global objects in the guest
- uses QuickJS memory and interrupt limits plus a parent-process wall-clock
  timeout
- enforces output, snapshot, log, and pending-call caps
- serializes host bridge values through a narrow JSON adapter
- converts host errors into plain guest errors, never host realm objects
- drops snapshots on timeout, abort, session end, or expiry
- rejects recursive access to `exec`, `wait`, and Tool Search control tools
- prevents convenience-name collisions from shadowing catalog helpers

The sandbox is one security layer; operators may still need OS-level
hardening for high-risk deployments.

## Error codes

```typescript
type CodeModeErrorCode =
  | "invalid_input"
  | "runtime_unavailable"
  | "timeout"
  | "output_limit_exceeded"
  | "snapshot_limit_exceeded"
  | "internal_error";
```

`invalid_input` covers bad `exec`/`wait` arguments, disabled languages,
rejected module access, TypeScript transform failures, unknown/expired/
wrong-scope `runId` values, and too many suspended runs. `runtime_unavailable`
covers a QuickJS worker that fails to start or exits non-zero.

Errors returned to the guest are plain data; host `Error` instances, stack
objects, prototypes, and host functions do not cross into QuickJS.

## Telemetry

Each result's `telemetry` field reports: hidden catalog size and a source
breakdown (`openclaw`/`mcp`/`client` counts), cumulative search/describe/call
counts for the run's catalog, and the model-visible tool names (`exec`,
`wait`, and retained direct-only tools).
The `counterScope` identifies one counter lifetime, changing when a catalog is
replaced or restored but remaining stable when tools are appended or prompt
policy narrows that catalog.

The run metadata (`meta.agentMeta` in `openclaw agent --json`, mirrored on the
`agent exec --json` envelope) adds per-run stats:

- `codeModeEngaged`: `true` only when code mode actually owned the model tool
  surface. This is the reliable engagement signal — do not infer engagement
  from config or tool names: the shell tool is also named `exec`, and the
  `"auto"` tier engages per model capability. Harnesses that bridge OpenClaw's
  tool surface (Copilot) report their resolved gate, so
  `codeModeEngaged: false` with `tools.codeMode.enabled=true` makes a silent
  no-op observable. Harnesses that run their own native tool surface (Codex)
  never engage OpenClaw code mode, so they always read `false`; an attempt that
  reports nothing is normalized to `false` for the same reason. Codex's own
  `codeModeOnly` is a separate native feature that this field does not track.
- `assistantTurns`: completed assistant/provider round trips across the run.
- `bridgeCalls`: the run's cumulative inner bridge counts
  (`{ search, describe, call }`). These calls never reach the provider;
  provider-visible outer tool calls remain in `meta.toolSummary.calls`.
- `costUsd`: estimated USD cost from the run's accumulated usage and the
  model's cost config (cache read/write tiers included); omitted when the
  model has no cost data.

Telemetry must not include secrets, raw environment values, or unredacted
tool inputs beyond existing OpenClaw trajectory policy.

## Debugging

Use targeted model transport logging when code mode behaves differently from
a normal tool run:

```bash
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_CODE_MODE=1 \
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_TRANSPORT=1 \
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_PAYLOAD=tools \
OPENCLAW_DEBUG_SSE=events \
openclaw gateway
```

For payload-shape debugging, use `OPENCLAW_DEBUG_MODEL_PAYLOAD=full-redacted`.
This logs a capped, redacted JSON snapshot of the model request; use it only
while debugging, since prompts and message text can still appear.

For stream debugging, use `OPENCLAW_DEBUG_SSE=peek` to log the first five
redacted SSE events. Code mode also fails closed if the final provider
payload does not contain exactly one `exec`, one `wait`, and only approved
direct-only tools after the code-mode surface has activated.

## Implementation layout

- config contract: `tools.codeMode`
- catalog builder: effective tools to compact entries and id map
- model-surface adapter: replace visible tools with control/direct tools
- QuickJS-WASI runtime adapter: load, eval, snapshot, restore, dispose
- worker supervisor: timeout, abort, crash isolation
- bridge adapter: JSON-safe host callbacks and result delivery
- TypeScript transform adapter
- snapshot store: TTL, size caps, run/session scoping
- trajectory projection for nested tool calls
- telemetry counters and diagnostics

The implementation reuses catalog and executor concepts from Tool Search, but
does not use a `node:vm` child as the sandbox.

## Validation checklist

Code mode coverage should prove:

- disabled config leaves existing tool exposure unchanged
- object config without `enabled: true` leaves code mode disabled
- enabled config exposes `exec`, `wait`, and only required direct-only tools to
  the model when tools are active for the run
- raw no-tool runs, `disableTools`, and empty allowlists do not trigger
  code-mode payload enforcement
- all catalog-eligible effective non-MCP tools appear in `ALL_TOOLS`
- direct-only tools stay model-visible and do not appear in `ALL_TOOLS`
- denied tools do not appear in `ALL_TOOLS`
- `tools.search`, `tools.describe`, `tools.callValue`, and `tools.call` work for OpenClaw tools
- `API.list("mcp")` and `API.read("mcp/<server>.d.ts")` expose TypeScript-style
  MCP declarations without a bridge/tool call
- MCP namespace `$api()` remains available as an inline fallback for schemas
- MCP namespace calls work for visible MCP tools with one object input, while
  direct MCP catalog entries are absent from `tools.*`
- Tool Search control tools are hidden from both the model surface and the
  hidden catalog
- nested calls preserve approval and hook behavior
- shell `exec` is hidden from the model but callable by catalog id when
  allowed
- recursive code-mode `exec` and `wait` are not callable from guest code
- TypeScript input is transformed and evaluated without loading TypeScript on
  disabled or JavaScript-only paths
- `import`, `require`, filesystem, network, and environment access fail
- infinite loops time out and cannot block the Gateway
- memory cap failures terminate the guest VM
- output and snapshot caps are enforced for completed and suspended calls
- `wait` resumes a suspended snapshot and returns the final value
- expired, aborted, wrong-session, and unknown `runId` values fail
- transcript replay and persistence preserve code-mode control calls
- transcript and telemetry show nested tool calls clearly

## E2E test plan

Run these as integration or end-to-end tests when changing the runtime:

1. Start a Gateway with `tools.codeMode.enabled: false`.
2. Send an agent turn with a small direct tool set.
3. Assert the model-visible tools are unchanged.
4. Restart with `tools.codeMode.enabled: true`.
5. Send an agent turn with OpenClaw, plugin, MCP, and client test tools.
6. Assert the model-visible tool list is `exec`, `wait`, plus only configured
   direct-only tools.
7. In `exec`, read `ALL_TOOLS` and assert the catalog-eligible effective test
   tools are present while direct-only tools are absent.
8. In `exec`, call OpenClaw/plugin/client tools through `tools.search`,
   `tools.describe`, and `tools.callValue` (or raw `tools.call`).
9. In `exec`, call `API.list("mcp")` and `API.read("mcp/<server>.d.ts")` and
   assert the declaration files describe visible MCP tools.
10. In `exec`, call MCP tools through `MCP.<server>.<tool>({ ...input })` and
    assert direct MCP catalog entries are absent from `ALL_TOOLS` and
    `tools.*`.
11. Assert denied tools are absent and cannot be called by guessed id.
12. Start a nested tool call that resolves after `exec` returns `waiting`.
13. Call `wait` and assert the restored VM receives the tool result.
14. Assert the final answer contains output produced after restore.
15. Assert timeout, abort, and snapshot expiry clean up runtime state.
16. Export trajectory and assert nested calls are visible under the parent
    code-mode call.

Docs-only changes to this page should still run `pnpm check:docs`.
